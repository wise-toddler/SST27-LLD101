Exercise C â€” Builder Pattern (Orders & Discounts)
-------------------------------------------------
Narrative: Order aggregate uses telescoping constructors and setters, allows invalid states, and leaks mutability from OrderLine.

Tasks:
1) Introduce Order.Builder with required id, customerEmail, and at least one line.
2) Validate email format, discount range 0..100, non-empty lines; centralize in build().
3) Make Order externally immutable (no setters, unmodifiable lines, defensive copy of lines).

Build/Run (Starter):
 cd builder-orders/src
 javac com/example/orders/*.java TryIt.java
 java TryIt
